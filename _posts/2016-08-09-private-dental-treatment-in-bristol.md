# Private Dental Treatment in Bristol

[Private dental treatment in Bristol costs][0] can vary widely from practice to practice and is totally dependent on the work that has been recommended, as the cost is based on the time spent in surgery, the complexity of work involved, the materials used and the level of sedation that is necessary.

Here at [CK Dental in Bristol][1], no unnecessary dental work is ever recommended. We understand that it can often seem very expensive, so we discuss all your options thoroughly at your consultation and explain clearly the level of necessity and implications of delaying dental work.

We provide you with a full and complete estimation of the costs in a written treatment plan and this is agreed with you before you go ahead with treatment. To assist patients further we have just signed up to a interest free payment plan, provided by Carefree Credit.

**Why should you take advantage of this dental payment plan?**

Carefree Credit is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and act in accordance with their rules to ensure responsible lending and good practice.

The process is very simple; a quick online application which takes around three minutes and the decision is instant. Carefree Credit offer an interest free payment option that can be paid over 12 months. Alternatively, there is a low cost payment option that can be spread out over 24 or 36 months.

There is no waiting round or need to delay dental treatment -- as soon as the application is approved, your Bristol dental practice is emailed so we know that we can start dental treatment immediately.

We are a leading Bristol dental surgery because of the quality of our highly trained staff and the gold standard equipment and materials we offer, all of which are very costly.
